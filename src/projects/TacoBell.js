                <p>Taco Bell came to Deutsch looking for a new way to deliver tasty tacos to the masses. The answer was to rebuild and redesign their site and include a robust feature that no other fast-food company had: an ordering system. I worked along side 3 other developers to make this happen. We worked closely with UX and design teams as the timeline for launch was tight. I not only worked on all global pieces like navigation and search but also helped by giving insight on user experience and design patterns.</p>
